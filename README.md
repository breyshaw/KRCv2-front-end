# Katie-Rayne-Creations with React!

Katie Rayne Creations Version 2 is custom clothing, tumbler, and craft site for my wife's small business. I completely remade it from the original MEN Stack application to use the wonderful capabilites of React! This is the front-end of the decoupled application. The backend can be found here: https://github.com/breyshaw/KRCv2-back-end

Katie Rayne Creations was developed as a full CRUD, MERN Stack mobile-responsive application. At an admin level, a user can perform full CRUD on this site. A regular user or logged out user can only read. The site is centered around the navigation bar. Each category/button on the navigation bar have their own react components bringing easy, quick, and efficient navigation to the site.
